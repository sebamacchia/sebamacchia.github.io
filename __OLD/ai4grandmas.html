            What's Artificial Intelligence?

        <p class="texto" style="color: blue;">
            Wikipedia: â€œIn computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is
            intelligence
            demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals."

                For several decades the ai was based on "expert systems",
                that is, super structured computer programs with rules; if ... do ...
                <br>
                <br>
                With the rise of Machine Learning in the 90s, there is a paradigm shift from which the computer itself
                learns with numerous examples (a lot of data) what those rules are necessary to solve a particular task.

            How does the computer learn by itself?

        <p class="texto" style="color: rgb(45, 44, 45);">
            To develop a machine learning system we need: data, an algorithm that processes that data, and some feedback
            signal that indicates to the system that it is doing the job well.
            <br>
            <br>
            For example, if we want to develop a system that detects people's faces in images, firstly, we need a lot
            of photos where it is highlighted (labeled) where the people's faces are.
            <br>
            Some specific algorithm of image processing is going to be in charge of looking for the faces of the people
            in the photos.
            <br>
            At the beginning it is likely to do very badly but with a correct feedback signal that
            rewards hits and penalizes mistakes, the system will be able to correct itself after many repetitions.

            While there have been many breakthroughs in the world of artificial intelligence, none come close to giving
            computers a human-like consciousness.
            <br>
            For now the tasks that the machines learn to solve are very specific
            <br>
            <br>
            But on the other hand the arms industry is already experimenting with AI and this is obviously a very
            possible problem in the future.

            Deep learning is an artificial intelligence function that imitates the workings of the human brain in
            processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine
            learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that
            is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.

            A universal basic income is a government guarantee that each citizen receives a minimum income.
            <br>
            The intention behind the payment is to provide enough to cover the basic cost of living and provide
            financial security. The concept has regained popularity as a way to offset job losses caused by technology.
